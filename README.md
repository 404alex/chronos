# Chronos
A small Docker container to run and schedule Python 3.7 scripts

## About
This container is good if you need to run a few or many Python scripts regularly, on a schedule or in response to certain events. The container runs Python 3.7.3 and thus is the interpreter used. Each script will be run in a virtual environment and it DOES support Pip dependencies. If you have access to the config directory, you can also run scripts and small modules bigger than one Python file.

## Installation
This program is ONLY available as a Docker container. See section about security for more information.
